# lighty-sig
Elegant solution to sign transactions from light clients 


### Signing transaction has never been so easy

**Now it's possible to sign transaction from anywhere** - (WIP)
- Messangers (Telegram, WeChat, Facebook messenger, Skype, e.t.c) :speech_balloon:
- IoT (Arduino, Raspberry, e.t.c) :slot_machine:
- Browsers (no plugins required like MetaMask :cat:)

This solution allow user to store it's private key locally as encrypted QR code (other image visualization). When it's needed to sign transaction user must open Web View mode (or any other app with JS engine inside) and decrypt it's QR code. After that sended transaction will be signed and sent automatically. :zap:

You don't have to fill write any code sign transaction. Just call `.sign()` method in relevant class, run the script, relax and take a cup of :coffee: while next block is mining! :tada:

### *What’s the point of a lighty-sig?*

You don't need to make your personal solution with signatures on light clients. It's similar to OAuth: when you don't need to solve all the problems with security and usability.  

### *Why should I care?*

Because software tools are for _people_. Our main aim is to help developers to make their app's faster and secure. :blue_heart:
